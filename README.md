# FIRST GIT README

Representation of technologies learnt in Software Development Course designed by Code Institute.

## Introduction

This was a walk through project designed to list all the technologies I will have learnt by the end of my course with Code Institute. It includes three pages named "Stream One" "Stream Two" and "Stream Three". Each Stream consists of clickable Logos of technologies as well as links beneath each logo, taking the user to the Wikipedia page about that specific technology.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### Visitor Goals
  - As a visitor, I want to immediately understand the purpose of the site.
  - As a visitor, I want to easily navigate through the site.
  - As a visitor, I want to get a quick visual clue of all the technologies leant through Code Institute.
  - As a visitor, I want to gain a general overview of each specific technology listed in the site.
  
- ### Design
  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The three main colours used in this walk through project are black, white and a charcoal colour.
  - #### Typography
    -  The site uses the Oswald font with a fallback of sans-serif incase the Oswald font does not get imported correctly into the site. The sans-serif font is easy to read and used often in programming.
  - #### Imagery
    - The logos of each technology listed is what makes the site so easy to understand at first glance.
   
## Features
- Each logo is clickable, taking the user to the Wikipedia site describing the specific technology which was clicked.
