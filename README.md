# FIRST GIT README

Representation of technologies learnt in Software Development Course designed by Code Institute.


## Introduction

This was a walk through project designed to list all the technologies I will have learnt by the end of my course with Code Institute. It includes three pages named "Stream One" "Stream Two" and "Stream Three". Each Stream consists of clickable Logos of technologies as well as links beneath each logo, taking the user to the Wikipedia page about that specific technology.
